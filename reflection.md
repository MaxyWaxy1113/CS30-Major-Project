What advice would I give myself if I were to do this project again?

If I were to do this project again, I would try and put more effort into learning some concepts by myself before turning to others or online videos for help. While the internet and peers were a very good way for me to work through my problems, I feel as though I would have achieved a deeper understanding of the concepts I used if I gave myself more time to think of my solutions without the influence of external factors.

Did I accomplish everything in my needs to have?
I achieved everything listed in my needs to have except the user feedback of green and red letters. I managed to succesfully incorporate the change in colour schemes listed in my nice to ahves

What was the hardest part of my project?

I realized that I am not a very gifted coder, and the hardest part of my project was simply getting my brain wrapped around some basic concepts. The main function used to draw and slice the array was the part that took me the longest to think of and execute. 

Were there any problems you could not solve?

For some reason, the text size when the game is on a red or green colour scheme is different fromt when it is on the default grey colour. I have no idea why it does that, and have tried to fix it to no avail. I also could not figure out how to keep the text always displayed and change the colour of the charachters based on the state of the user input, so I decided to execute the typing test in a slighlty different (easier) way by removing index 0 of the array if the correct input occurs
